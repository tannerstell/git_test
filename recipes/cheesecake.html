        <p>After a nice meal, what's better than to top it off with cheesecake, my favorite desert! I'll be honest, I've never made a homemade cheesecake in my life, but I will eat it.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A graham cracker crust is the base of this easy cheesecake recipe. Crush whole graham crackers or purchase pre-crushed crumbs at the store.</li>
	    <li>Melted butter holds the crust together while adding rich flavor.</li>
	    <li>You'll need 1 ¼ cups sugar, divided — ¼ cup for the crust, 1 cup for the filling.</li>
	    <li>Allow the cream cheese to come to room temperature before making the filling. If you don't have time, you can soften it quickly by beating it or microwaving it in short intervals.</li>
	    <li>One cup of sour cream adds richness, tanginess, and complexity to this perfect cheesecake recipe.</li>
	    <li>Two teaspoons of vanilla adds flavor and brings out the subtle flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
	    <li>Three whole eggs ensure a smooth, creamy, thick cheesecake filling.</li>
	    <li>Top this cheesecake with canned pie filling for a restaurant-worthy finish.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
            <li><b>Make the Crust</b>: Mix the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and some of the sugar in a bowl. Use your fingertips to press the mixture into the bottom of a springform pan.</li>

<li><b>Make the Filling</b>: Beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the sour cream and vanilla. Beat in the eggs one at a time on low speed. Pour the filling over the crust.</li>

<li><b>Bake the Cheesecake</b>: Bake the cheesecake in a preheated oven until the filling is almost set. Run a knife around the rim to loosen the sides and allow it to cool before removing it from the pan. Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least four hours before serving.</li>
        </ol>
